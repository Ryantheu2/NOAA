The Dashboard_Code folder contains code for taking in NOAA-20 and Suomi SNPP data, cleaning the data, fixing them to their proper coordinates, 
and breaking them up into tiles. These are then saved in a particular file order so that they can be displayed in an openlayers format on the 
NOAA climate Dashboard.

The Python_Presentation folder contains code that has been used during python training workshops. These code examples teach users how to get 
NOAA-20 and Suomi SNPP data, extract it from its NetCDF file, interact with each band within the file, display the data, and even create 
animations with multiple files.
